Around his waist is a serpent biting its own tail, a traditional symbol of eternity, specifically “the eternity of attainment in the spirit”.    In his right hand, he holds a wand raised towards the heavens, while his left-hand points to the earth, symbolizing the connection between the spiritual and material realms. This gesture draws down divine energy, allowing the Magician to harness its power for creative purposes.  On the table before him are the four symbols of the Tarot suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles.  These represent the four elements of natural life (fire, water, air, and earth) and signify that the Magician has mastery over these elements and can use them to create his desired reality.

The card suggests that through this voluntary suspension, one can achieve a heightened state of awareness and access a deeper understanding of self and the universe.  ",
        details:
          "The imagery of the card is rich with symbolism:  \n\n*   **Suspension:** The figure hanging upside down signifies a reversal of the ordinary way of seeing things. This is not a position of suffering but of deliberate choice, suggesting a willingness to step outside conventional perspectives. \n*   **Tau and Fylfot Crosses:** The gallows form a Tau cross, an ancient symbol of life and redemption. The figure's body creates a fylfot cross (also known as a swastika), which, in its original context, represents auspiciousness and good fortune. The combination of these crosses hints at a complex process of transformation and spiritual evolution through sacrifice. \n*   **Nimbus:** The halo around the figure's head points to a state of enlightenment or heightened consciousness attained through this unique form of suspension.  \n*   **Living Tree:** The figure hangs from a living tree with leaves, emphasizing that this is not a state of stagnation but a different kind of life and growth. It signifies that surrender can lead to new forms of development. \n*   **Peaceful Expression:** The figure's face does not show pain but rather deep contemplation and a sense of peace.
